# cerberus
A Kerberos (version 5) implementation.

This is an implementation of the Kerberos v5 authentication protocol, entirely in Common Lisp. 

## 1. Introduction
Kerberos is the de facto standard method of authentication over a network, notably in Microsoft Windows environments.

The basic principal of Kerberos is there is a trusted central authority which stores credentials (password equivalents)
for each principal (user account). This is knowns as the Key Distribution Centre (KDC). 
A client can prove its identity to an application server by requesting a message from the KDC 
which is encrypted with the server's private key. Only the server (and the KDC) have the knowledge to decrypt this message,
the client itself does not. The client forwards this message to the server, who decrypts it and examines 
the contents of the message. Inside it will be some proof (e.g. a recent timestamp) that the client is who they say they are. 

In its simplest form, the Kerberos protocol consists of the following sequence of exchanges:
* Client sends a message to authentication service component of the KDC requesting a ticket for the ticket-granting server (TGS)
* The AS responds with a message encrypted with the client's private key, only the client can decrypt this message.
* The client sends a request to the TGS for a ticket to the desired principal (application server).
* The client sends this ticket to the application server using the relevant application protocol. 
* The application server validates the ticket and approves access to the client.

The details get more complicated, but that is the general idea.

## 2. Project aims
- [x] Be able to encode/decode all the relevant DER-encoded ASN.1 messages 
- [x] Support a suffiently wide range of encryption profiles to be useful. In practise this means the ones supported by
Microsoft. 
- [x] Send AS-REQ messages to the KDC to get TGTs 
- [x] Send TGS-REQ messages to the KDC to get credentials for application servers
- [x] Encode/decode AP-REQ messages to send to applicaiton servers
- [x] Validate AP-REQ messages to authenticate clients
- [x] Wrap AP-REQ messages with the KRB5 OID, as required for GSS
- [ ] Some sort of GSSAPI integration? 
- [ ] Long term aim: write a KDC server

## 3. Usage
The public API is not finalized yet, but at the moment you can do something like:

```
;; client logs in to the AS and requests a TGT
CL-USER> (defparameter *tgt* (cerberus:request-tgt "Administrator" "password" "REALM" :kdc-address "10.1.1.1"))
*TGT*
;; request credentials to talk to the user "Administrator"
CL-USER> (defparameter *creds* (cerberus:request-credentials *tgt* (cerberus:principal "Administrator")))
*CREDS*
;; pack an AP-REQ structure to be sent to the application server
CL-USER> (defparameter *buffer* (cerberus:pack-initial-context-token (cerberus:make-ap-request *creds*)))
*BUFFER*
;; send the *BUFFER* to the application server using whatever protocol you need

;; ----- send the buffer to the application server -----
;; we are now on the application server

;; the application server must first generate a list of keys for the various encryption profiles
CL-USER> (defparameter *keylist* (cerberus:generate-keylist "password" :username "Administrator" :realm "REALM"))
*KEYLIST*
;; the application server receives the packed AP-REQ and validates it 
CL-USER> (cerberus:valid-ticket-p *keylist* (cerberus:unpack-initial-context-token *buffer*))
T

```

## 4. Encryption profiles
Cerberus supports a set of encryption "profiles", which are implemented by specializing a set of generic functions.
Currently, it has support for the following: 
* DES-CBC-MD5, DES-CBC-MD4, DES-CBC-CRC
* DES3-CBC-SHA1-KD
* RC4-HMAC, RC4-HMAC-EXP
* AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-KD, AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-KD. 


- [x] The simple DES-based profiles are all implemented and appear to be working, DES-CBC-MD5, DES-CBC-MD4 and DES-CBC-CRC.
- [x] The Microsoft profiles, RC4-HMAC and RC4-HMAC-EXP appear to be working correctly. 
- [x] The triple-des profile, DES3-CBC-SHA1-KD, is implemented and looks like it's working. 
- [x] The AES128 and AES256 profiles are working correctly.

## 5. Keytab files
You can load keytab files (as output from other Kerberos implementations, such from ktpass utility) using 
```
CL-USER> (cerberus:load-keytab "my.keytab")
```
This returns a list of KEYTAB-ENTRY structures, which include informtaion about the principal as well as the 
encryption key. 

## 6. TODO
- [ ] Need to be able to renew tickets.
- [ ] Somehow need to be able to use this in an application that requires GSS support.
- [x] Need to support encrypting application messages using the session key.
- [ ] Some sort of credential cache, i.e. database of TGTs and tickets for other principals
- [ ] Support cross-realm requests and tickets

## 7. Notes
* Encryption functions provided by the ironclad package.
* The ASN.1 serializer is specific to this project and NOT a generalized ASN.1 (DER) serializer. It makes certain assumptions which are valid
in the context of Kerberos messages, but are not generally applicable. Perhaps it could form the basis of one in the future.
* This was developed and tested against the Windows KDC (i.e. active directory). It should work with other KDCs such as MIT and Heimdal, 
but I've not tried.
* Need to understand the MS-PAC structures, these contain authorization data that is likely to be very useful. 
* GSSAPI structures look simpler than I thought -- maybe just wrapping an InitialContextToken with an OID?
